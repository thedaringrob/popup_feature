# popup_feature

Brandon, still slogging through media query stuff

Weird cookie bug right now -- If I click subscribe cookie is created but refresh page and it doesn't yet realize that I've already signed up. I'm assuming it's an issue with my getTime function.

You'll also notice an "X" placholder and "social icons placeholder"  I saw that these are already usable images in the WP files but didn't know where to put this popup so I didn't link those in just yet.

Also too, didn't apply font or anything because once files are in the right spot styling will do it's thing
